        The Structure of a Formal Letter
      </h2>
      <p>
        Understanding the basic structure of a formal letter is the first step
        in mastering the art. Unlike casual communication, a formal letter
        follows a specific format that conveys respect and clarity. Here’s a
        breakdown:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Sender’s Address: </strong> Your address, including the
          street, city, and postcode, goes at the top right or left of the
          letter.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Date: </strong> The date the letter is written should be
          placed below the sender’s address.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Recipient’s Address:</strong> The recipient's address,
          including their title and organisation, is placed on the left, below
          the sender’s address.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Salutation: </strong> A respectful greeting such as “Dear Mr.
          Smith” or “Dear Sir/Madam” is essential.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Body: </strong> The body is the main part of the letter, where
          you express your purpose clearly and concisely.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Closing: </strong> A polite closing, such as “Yours sincerely”
          or “Yours faithfully,” followed by your signature.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Subsection: Getting the Tone Right -->
      <h3 class="subsection-title">Getting the Tone Right</h3>
      <p>
        One of the most important aspects of a formal letter is the tone. Unlike
        informal letters or emails, a formal letter requires a tone of respect
        and professionalism. Avoid slang, contractions, or overly casual
        language. Instead, aim for clear, concise, and polite language. For
        example, instead of saying “I want,” opt for “I would like” or “I kindly
        request.”
      </p>

      <h2 id="clarity-heading" class="section-title">
        The Importance of Clarity
      </h2>
      <p>
        When writing a formal letter, clarity is key. The reader should
        immediately understand the purpose of your letter. Start with a clear
        statement of your intent in the opening paragraph. For instance, if
        you’re applying for a job, begin with “I am writing to apply for the
        position of...” Follow this with relevant details that support your
        purpose, such as your qualifications or the reason for your request.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">Avoiding Common Pitfalls</h3>
      <p>
        Even the most experienced writers can make mistakes when crafting a
        formal letter. Here are some common pitfalls to avoid:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Overly Complex Language: </strong> While it’s important to be
          formal, avoid using overly complex language that can confuse the
          reader. Simplicity and clarity should always be your goals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Lengthy Sentences: </strong> Keep your sentences concise.
          Long, winding sentences can be hard to follow and may obscure your
          message.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Neglecting Proofreading: </strong> Spelling and grammar
          errors can undermine your professionalism. Always proofread your
          letter before sending it.
        </li>
      </ul>
