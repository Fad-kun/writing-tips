        Resigning from a job can be challenging under any circumstances, but
        resigning due to illness adds an emotional layer that can be
        particularly tough. When health concerns make it impossible to continue
        working, crafting a thoughtful resignation letter is essential to
        communicate your situation clearly and maintain professionalism.

        The Importance of Clarity and Compassion
      </h2>
      <p>
        Your resignation letter should strike a balance between being honest
        about your health and being considerate of your employer's needs. It's
        important to explain that your resignation is due to medical reasons
        without oversharing personal details. For example, you might say:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          Due to ongoing health concerns, I am no longer able to meet the
          demands of my position and must resign effective [date].
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach maintains privacy while ensuring your employer understands
        that the decision is not taken lightly.

        The Importance of Clarity and Compassion
      </h2>
      <p>
        When resigning due to illness, the timing of your notice is crucial. If
        your condition allows, providing a standard notice period (typically two
        weeks) is courteous. However, if your illness requires immediate
        resignation, it's important to communicate this as early as possible.
        Your letter might include:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          Unfortunately, due to the urgent nature of my health situation, I am
          unable to provide the usual notice period and must resign immediately.
        </em>
      </p>

    <!-- Section: Offering to Assist in the Transition -->

      <h2 id="assist-transition-heading" class="section-title">
        Offering to Assist in the Transition
      </h2>
      <p>
        Even in a difficult situation, offering to help with the transition
        shows professionalism and consideration. You could offer to train a
        replacement or provide a detailed handover of your responsibilities if
        your health permits. This gesture can leave a positive impression and
        maintain a good relationship with your employer:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          I am committed to making this transition as smooth as possible and am
          willing to assist in any way I can during my remaining time.
        </em>
      </p>

        Emotional Tone and Gratitude
      </h2>
      <p>
        A resignation letter due to illness should convey your appreciation for
        the opportunity you had at the company. This helps in leaving on good
        terms and shows that despite the circumstances, you value the experience
        gained. For instance:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          I want to express my gratitude for the support and opportunities I
          have received during my time with [Company]. It has been a privilege
          to work with such a dedicated team.
        </em>
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section: Closing the Letter -->
    <section aria-labelledby="closing-letter-heading">
      <h2 id="closing-letter-heading" class="section-title">
        Closing the Letter
      </h2>
      <p>
        Conclude your letter on a positive note, expressing your hope for the
        company's continued success and providing your contact details for any
        further communication. For example:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          Thank you for your understanding during this difficult time. I wish
          the company continued success in all its endeavours. Please feel free
          to contact me at [phone number/email] for any additional information
          or assistance.
        </em>

        Writing a resignation letter due to illness requires sensitivity and
        clarity. By focusing on clear communication, offering to help with the
        transition, and maintaining a positive tone, you can resign
        professionally while honouring your health needs. This approach not only
        ensures you leave on good terms but also helps you focus on your
        recovery without unnecessary stress.
