      <p>
        Paraphrasing is a writing skill that goes beyond simply changing a few
        words. It involves rewording a passage while maintaining its original
        meaning, which is crucial for avoiding plagiarism, enhancing
        comprehension, and improving communication. Understanding how to
        paraphrase effectively can elevate your writing, whether you're a
        student, professional, or writer.

        What Is Paraphrasing and Why Is It Important?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Paraphrasing is the process of rewriting someone else's ideas in your
        own words while preserving the original meaning. It allows writers to
        incorporate the thoughts and research of others into their work without
        directly quoting large sections of text.
      </p>

      <!-- Subsection: Why Paraphrasing Matters -->
      <h3 class="subsection-title">Why Paraphrasing Matters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoiding Plagiarism: </strong> Proper paraphrasing helps
          prevent plagiarism, which is the unethical act of presenting someone
          else's work as your own.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Demonstrating Understanding: </strong> Paraphrasing shows that
          you understand the original text and can convey its meaning
          accurately.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enhancing Your Voice: </strong> By paraphrasing, you can
          integrate research and references into your writing in a way that
          aligns with your own style and voice.

        The Difference Between Paraphrasing and Summarising
      </h2>
      <p>
        While both paraphrasing and summarising involve rewording text, they
        serve different purposes and require different approaches.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Paraphrasing: </strong> Involves rewording a specific passage,
          typically keeping the same length as the original while preserving the
          details and meaning.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Summarising: </strong> Involves condensing the main ideas of a
          longer text into a shorter version, focusing only on the key points.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Subsection: Examples -->
      <h3 class="subsection-title">Examples</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong> Original: </strong> "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy
          dog."
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Paraphrased: </strong> "The swift brown fox leaps over the
          sleeping dog."
        </li>
        <li><strong> Summarised: </strong> "A fox jumps over a dog."</li>

        Techniques for Effective Paraphrasing
      </h2>
      <p>
        Effective paraphrasing requires more than changing words; it involves a
        deep understanding of the text and the ability to express the same ideas
        differently.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong> Change Sentence Structure: </strong> Alter the structure of
          the sentence while keeping the original meaning intact.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Use Synonyms: </strong> Replace key words with synonyms that
          convey the same meaning, but be cautious of words with multiple
          meanings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Break Up Long Sentences: </strong> Divide long, complex
          sentences into shorter, simpler ones.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Change the Voice: </strong> Switch between active and passive
          voice to change the focus of the sentence.
        </li>
