    <section aria-label="Introduction to Epithets">
      <p>
        When we think about language's ability to shape reality, one of the most
        fascinating tools at our disposal is the epithet. Epithets have been
        used throughout history to define characters, places, and events,
        influencing how we perceive them. But what exactly are epithets, and how
        do they work?

        What is an Epithet?
      </h2>
      <p>
        An epithet is a descriptive phrase or adjective that is closely
        associated with a person, place, or thing, often used to highlight a
        particular quality. For instance, in Homer’s Iliad, Achilles is often
        referred to as “swift-footed Achilles,” emphasising his speed and
        agility. Epithets can be complimentary, neutral, or even derogatory,
        depending on the context and intent.

      <h3 class="subsection-title">
        Historical Roots and Literary Significance
      </h3>
      <p>
        Epithets have deep roots in ancient literature, especially in epic
        poetry. They were often used to fill out the meter in verses, but they
        also served a more profound purpose: to reinforce the characteristics of
        a figure or place in the minds of the audience. Homer’s works are filled
        with such epithets, from “rosy-fingered dawn” to “wine-dark sea,” each
        phrase adding to the rich tapestry of the narrative.
      </p>

      <!-- Subsection: Epithets in Everyday Language -->
      <h3 class="subsection-title">Epithets in Everyday Language</h3>
      <p>
        While we often associate epithets with literature, they are just as
        prevalent in everyday language. Think of how historical figures like
        “Alexander the Great” or “Ivan the Terrible” are instantly defined by
        their epithets. These phrases are not just names; they are tools of
        branding, shaping our perception before we even delve into the details
        of their lives.

      <!-- Subsection: The Double-Edged Sword of Epithets-->
      <h3 class="subsection-title">The Double-Edged Sword of Epithets</h3>
      <p>
        However, epithets are not always benign. They can also be used to
        stereotype, pigeonhole, or diminish someone or something. In political
        discourse, for example, epithets like “crooked” or “sleepy” are often
        used to undermine opponents. These words carry connotations that can be
        hard to shake, influencing public perception in powerful ways.

        The Creative Use of Epithets in Modern Writing
      </h2>
      <p>
        In modern writing, epithets can be a creative way to add depth and
        flavour to characters or settings. Authors often use them to evoke
        specific imagery or to quickly establish a character’s dominant traits.
        For instance, in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series, the epithet “The
        Boy Who Lived” becomes synonymous with Harry’s identity and his place in
        the wizarding world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Epithets also play a role in branding and marketing. Companies often use
        them to create memorable images in consumers' minds. Think of phrases
        like “America’s Favourite Coffee” or “The King of Beers.” These epithets
        are designed to stick, making the brand instantly br recognisable and
        associated with a particular quality.

        The Lasting Impact of Epithets
      </h2>
      <p>
        Whether used in ancient epics or modern advertising, epithets have a
        unique ability to distill complex ideas into simple, memorable phrases.
        They can elevate, define, or diminish their subjects with just a few
        well-chosen words. As we navigate a world filled with epithets, it’s
        essential to understand their power and the subtle ways they shape our
        perceptions and interactions.
